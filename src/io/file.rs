//! File handling utilities for the Aurora Font Library. This module provides
//! functions to read and write font files, as well as manage file paths and directories.

// The current implementation doesn't handle file management yet.
// It expects the client to handle file reading and writing externally.
// File data should be provided to the decompression module as byte slices.
// Then passed as a FontDataStream for further processing by the library.

// This file is a placeholder for future file handling utilities should
// the library incorporate direct file management features in the future.
